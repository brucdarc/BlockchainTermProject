# EcoCapCoin

EcoCapCoin is a custom ERC20 token for cap and trade pollution permits. The contracts include funtionality to view where tokens are distributed. 

Each polluter is registered to a location, and sensors can add pollution to the public storage on chain to show when companies pollute. 
There is also functality to set limits on pollution based on the number of tokens owned, and check if polluters go over their allocated pollution amounts.

Token holders can also burn EcoCapCoin to permanently decrease the number of tokens, meaning that less pollution will permently be allowed for that area.

Contracts are run through solidity, and the front end interface is done with react.
